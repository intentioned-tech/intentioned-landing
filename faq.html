        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Common questions about Intentioned and social skills training</p>
        
        <div class="category-header">Moderation & Safety</div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Why is the default moderation prompt not strict at all?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>
                    Modern large language models (LLMs) like Qwen, Gemma, and others already have extensive built-in safety 
                    guardrails and content filtering. These models are trained to refuse harmful requests, avoid generating 
                    dangerous content, and maintain ethical boundaries by default.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Adding an overly strict moderation layer on top of these already-cautious models creates a problematic 
                    "double filtering" effect that severely impedes innocent conversations. Users practicing difficult 
                    scenarios—like handling an angry customer, negotiating assertively, or discussing sensitive topics 
                    in therapy contexts—would constantly trigger false positives.
                </p>
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <strong>Example:</strong> A user practicing "How do I tell my boss I'm overwhelmed?" might use words 
                    like "stressed," "can't cope," or "breaking down." Overly strict moderation would flag this as a 
                    mental health crisis, interrupting legitimate professional communication practice.
                </div>
                <p>
                    Our moderation is designed to catch only the most extreme cases (direct, actionable threats to real 
                    individuals) while allowing the natural flow of difficult conversation practice. The underlying 
                    LLM handles the rest.

            <div class="faq-question">What language models can I use?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Intentioned supports a wide range of language models through HuggingFace Transformers:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Qwen 2.5 (Recommended):</strong> 1B, 3B, 7B variants - excellent multilingual support</li>
                    <li><strong>Google Gemma:</strong> 2B, 7B, 9B variants - good for general conversation</li>
                    <li><strong>Llama 3:</strong> 8B variant - strong English performance</li>
                    <li><strong>Mistral:</strong> 7B variant - fast inference</li>
                    <li><strong>GEITje (Dutch):</strong> 7B - specialized for Dutch language</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <strong>🔓 Model Flexibility:</strong> Any model compatible with HuggingFace Transformers can be used—not just the ones listed above. 
                    This is a major strength of Intentioned. However, you should <strong>always test models thoroughly</strong> before deploying them 
                    and <strong>check their license terms</strong> to ensure compliance with your use case and applicable regulations.

                        <li>1-3B models: 4-6GB VRAM (RTX 3060 12GB works great)</li>
                        <li>7-9B models: 8-12GB VRAM (RTX 3080/3090 recommended)</li>

                    <strong>⚠️ CPU-Only Mode:</strong> If you don't have a GPU, you'll need to use much smaller models (1B-3B parameters max) 
                    and ensure you have sufficient RAM (16GB+ recommended). CPU inference is significantly slower than GPU inference.
                </div>
                <p>
                    Configure your model in the <code>config.json</code> file or through the configuration tool. 
                    Models are automatically downloaded from HuggingFace on first use.

                    We understand that many regions face severe economic challenges, including currency devaluation, 
                    hyperinflation, or de facto dollarization that makes international software services unaffordable.

                <ul>
                    <li>Valid proof of your address (utility bill, government ID, etc.)</li>

                    full access to the software and critical updates.
                    
                    We also do not offer these plans for EU customers due to GDPR compliance costs. Dollarization relief 
                    plans are currently not available in Ukraine, Russia, Israel, the Golan Heights, 
                    Palestine/West Bank/Gaza Strip, and Syria due to ongoing conflicts and potential economic instability that 
                    would make consistent pricing impossible in addition to potential sanctions. These regions can still get reduced pricing through academic or 
                    non-profit channels so those with no malice intent can access our software.

                <p>
                    This is a valid concern, especially for users in the United States and Europe where tariffs 
                    on electronics can significantly impact pricing. Here's our perspective:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Used Market:</strong> The RTX 3060 12GB and RTX 3090 are now previous-generation 
                    cards with a healthy used market. Prices on these cards tend to be more stable.
                    Try to avoid the RTX 20 series and earlier as these cards are very expensive and less efficient.
                    These cards are also more gamer oriented than AI efficient as some are made before the
                    advent of AI workloads.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cloud Alternatives:</strong> For users who cannot obtain local hardware, 
                    cloud GPU services (Vast.ai, RunPod, Lambda Labs) offer hourly rentals.</li>
                    <li><strong>CPU Fallback:</strong> While slower, models can run on CPU with llama.cpp 
                    for users without GPU access.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lighter Models:</strong> We're optimizing for smaller models (1-3B parameters) 
                    that run on more accessible hardware like the RTX 4060.</li>
                    <li><strong>Do not get a GT series GPU with a high number (e.g., GT 1030, GT 710, etc.)</strong> as these are
                    not designed for AI workloads, extremely old by modern standards, and will perform poorly or potentially not run at all.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stay Informed:</strong> Be aware of scams and price gouging in the hardware market. Many RTX 30 series cards have been replaced with GT series cards.
                    There have been instances of sellers misrepresenting GT series cards as RTX series cards to take advantage of high demand.</li>
                    <li>In addition, some GPUs have been replaced with literal rocks in packaging, have had chips removed, or have been otherwise tampered with to deceive buyers.</li>
                    <li>If you receive a GPU that appears tampered with or not as described, report the seller immediately and avoid using the hardware. If necessary, contact the platform or payment provider to dispute the transaction.
                    In addition, consider leaving a review or warning for other potential buyers to prevent further scams. Contact the police as well if need be. Initiate a chargeback or regional equivalent if needed to
                    force your money back via your credit card company.</li>
                    <li><strong>BUYER BEWARE: Always use CREDIT when buying GPUs for proof of purchase and seller protection. If buying from a friend, make sure you pay through paypal or similar and enable seller protection. Pay the additional
                    fees if needed to ensure you have recourse in case of fraud and to make sure your seller is paid the price you agreed upon. You may need a calculator for this. Google "PayPal transaction fee seller protection percentage."</strong></li>

                    <strong>⚠️ Cloud Usage Warning:</strong> If you choose to use cloud GPU services instead of local hardware, 
                    we <strong>strongly recommend selecting a GDPR-compliant provider</strong> with servers in your region. 
                    Using cloud services means your conversation data leaves your machine, which introduces privacy risks. 
                    This is inherently riskier than running locally—proceed with caution and review each provider's data handling policies.
